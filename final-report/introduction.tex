\section{Introduction}

The shipping industry is arguably the only transport sector whose operations remain relatively untouched by developments in technology. Shipping companies have been slow to adopt the latest innovations, instead preferring to stick with tried and tested norms. Ships simply continue to grow in size, putting incredible pressure on coastal infrastructure. In this report we present OceanX: an innovative prototype system which leverages collaborative autonomy in order to improve the efficiency of cargo movement. We believe that our OceanX system seizes several important market opportunities by capitalising on the lack of innovation the industry has shown to date.

We begin with a description of our system’s key features, and the architecture of our code base. We outline which elements we decided to implement to showcase the system in our simulation engine, and we assess the work that must be undertaken to bring the system to an initially deployable state. We then conduct a market assessment, reaching a determination as to how technically and financially viable it would be to develop and deploy the OceanX system. We conclude with a summary of our group’s performance, outlining areas in which we collaborated strongly, and considering aspects we would approach differently if we were to undertake a similar project in future.
