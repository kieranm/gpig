	\section{Introduction}
	Unsustainable growth in the cargo shipping industry, paired with a lack of innovation, puts incredible pressure on the environment and threatens to destabilise the economy. In this report, we illustrate how we intend to leverage collaborative autonomy to develop a more sustainable approach. We describe a possible solution involving the use of `off-shore ports' along with small, autonomous shuttle boats  which serve to provide a link with traditional coastal ports. 
	
	We begin with a discussion of the challenges facing the industry, and we make some informed assumptions about the capabilities of the technology at our disposal in the year 2030. We then describe our proposed solution, outlining key benefits, and explaining how we will justify our approach through simulation. We also provide a brief summary of our team structure, the key processes we will follow, and our customer communication strategy. We conclude with a register of significant project risks.

	\section{Team Structure and Roles}
	\label{team_structure}
	
	We elected at an early stage to adopt a well-defined team structure by assigning a logistical role to each member. Members conduct their logistical role in addition to any writing or engineering tasks assigned to them. The assignment of members to roles was a group exercise. We took into account individual strengths and areas of previous experience.

			\textbf{Role} & \textbf{Member} & \textbf{Primary Responsibilities} & \textbf{Previous Experience} \\
		\hline
		Chair & 
		KM & 
		Compile the agenda for each meeting; run each meeting; maintain the risk register; distribution of writing tasks. &
		Kieran acted as an academic representative and Chair of the departmental Staff Student forum for two years. \\
		\hline
		Secretary & 
		LW & 
		Organise each meeting; take minutes for meetings; assign actions; distribution of writing tasks; report submissions. & 
		During his placement, Liam organised and ran several client meetings with stakeholders for his project. \\

	\section{Risk Register}
	
	We identified the following ongoing risks, assigning a mitigation strategy to each, as well as a relevant owner based on the roles described in Section \ref{team_structure}.

			\hline
			\textbf{ID} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Likelihood} &
			\textbf{Impact} & \textbf{Owner} & \textbf{Mitigation} \\
			\hline
			1 & 
			Team members are unable to complete writing tasks in a timely fashion due to illness or preoccupation with other work. & 
			Low & 
			High & 
			KM/LW & \\
			\hline
			2 & 
			Team members struggle to complete assigned programming tasks in time due to lack of experience with the chosen technologies. & 
			Medium & 
			High & 
			OL & \\
			\hline
			3 & 
			The chosen languages, frameworks, or libraries are too difficult to learn, have compatibility issues, or do not have the expected capabilities. 
			& 
			Medium & 
			High & 
			MW & \\
			\hline
			4 & 
			Progress on programming tasks is delayed due to poor code quality, duplication of effort, or conflicting code commits by team members. & 
			Medium &

			5 & 
			The customer is not available to give comments on proposed changes or additions to the system specification. & 
			Medium & 
			Low & 
			PK & \\
			\hline
			6 &
			Incomplete metrics due to members not completing the daily online `stand-up', forgetting to log their activity, or not maintaining their action tickets. & 
			High & 
			Low & LS & \\
			\hline
			7 & 
			Loss of writing or code due to failure of team members' hardware and lack of regular backup/commit. & 
			Low & 
			High & KM/OL & \\
			\hline
			8 & 
			Team members are not aware of assigned tasks, or complete the wrong tasks, due to not attending meetings, or being late to meetings. &
			High & 
			Medium & 
			LW & \\
			\hline
			9 & 
			Difficulty completing programming tasks on time due to underestimation of work involved or too broad a scope. & 
			Medium & 
			High & 
			MW/OL & \\
			\hline
			10 & 
			Delays in creating the prototype due to the identification of a major design flaw in the system specification. &
