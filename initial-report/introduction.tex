    \section{Introduction}
    Unsustainable growth in the cargo shipping industry, paired with a lack of innovation, puts incredible pressure on the environment and threatens to destabilise the economy. In this report, we illustrate how we intend to leverage collaborative autonomy to develop a more sustainable approach. We describe a possible solution involving the use of `off-shore ports' along with small, autonomous shuttle boats  which serve to provide a link with traditional coastal ports. 
    
    We begin with a discussion of the challenges facing the industry, and we make some informed assumptions about the capabilities of the technology at our disposal in the year 2030. We then describe our proposed solution, outlining key benefits, and explaining how we will justify our approach through simulation. We also provide a brief summary of our team structure, the key processes we will follow, and our customer communication strategy. We conclude with a register of significant project risks.
