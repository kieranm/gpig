    \section{Team Structure and Roles}
    \label{team_structure}
    
    We elected at an early stage to adopt a well-defined team structure by assigning a logistical role to each member. Members conduct their logistical role in addition to any writing or engineering tasks assigned to them. The assignment of members to roles was a group exercise. We took into account individual strengths and areas of previous experience.
