    \section{Risk Register}

	We identified the following ongoing risks, assigning a mitigation strategy to each, as well as a relevant owner based on the roles described in Section \ref{team_structure}.

            Med &
            High &
            MW &
            \textbf{Reduction:} Choose technologies that are already familiar to team members, with known capabilities and limitations. \\
            \hline
            4 &
            Progress on programming tasks is delayed due to poor code quality, duplication of effort, or conflicting code commits by team members. &

            AZ &
            \textbf{Reduction:} Communicate intention and ownership of particular work through GitHub Projects and Slack, as well as during stand-ups. \\

            \textbf{Reduction:} Ensure questions are asked within a reasonable time-frame from when a response would be required. \\
            \hline
            6 &
            Incomplete metrics due to members not completing the daily online `stand-up' or forgetting to log their activity/ticket progress. &
            High &
            Low & LS &
            \textbf{Reduction:} Team reminders that notify individuals that have yet to complete the stand-up. \\
            \hline
            7 &
            Loss of report or code due to failure of team members' hardware and lack of regular backups. &
            Low &
            High & KM/OL &
            \textbf{Reduction:} Use of git and GitHub as a software versioning and backup system for the code-base. \\
            \hline
            8 &
            Team members unaware of assigned tasks, or complete wrong tasks, due to not attending meetings, or being late to meetings. &

            Med &
            LW &
            \textbf{Reduction:} Communication between absent members regarding prompt and required attendance to team meetings. \\
            \hline
            9 &
            Difficulty completing programming tasks on time due to underestimation of work involved or too broad a scope. &
            Med &
            High &
            MW/OL &
            \textbf{Reduction:} Ensure assigned tasks are well-defined and properly understood before producing estimations. \\
            \hline
            10 &
            Delays in creating the prototype due to the identification of a major design flaw in the system specification. &
            Low &
            High &
            KM/LW &
            \textbf{Reduction:} Guarantee the software specification is complete and agreed upon before the development process begins. \\
