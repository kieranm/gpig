    \section{Risk Register}

    We identified the following ongoing risks, assigning a mitigation strategy to each, as well as a relevant owner based on the roles described in Section \ref{team_structure}.

            Ensure questions are asked within a reasonable time-frame from when a response would be required. \\
            \hline
            6 &
            Incomplete metrics due to members not completing the daily online `stand-up', forgetting to log their activity, or not maintaining their action tickets. &
            High &
            Low & LS &
            Team reminders that notify individuals that have yet to complete the stand-up. \\
            \hline

            High & KM/OL &
            Use of git and GitHub as a software versioning and backup system for the code-base. \\
            \hline
            8 &
            Team members are not aware of assigned tasks, or complete the wrong tasks, due to not attending meetings, or being late to meetings. &

            MW/OL &
            Ensure that the assigned tasks are well-defined, well understood and properly evaluated before estimating their required time. \\
